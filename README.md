# linked-scraper
A Python web scraper for LinkedIn. A working one, eventually.

The web scraper uses Python3.8 and selenium to achieve its task. It scrapes your search query, stores links to the found persons in a txt file and connects your account with them.
<br/> Use **python linked-scraper.py -h** to get an overview of possible options.
